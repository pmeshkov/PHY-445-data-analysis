A reposity containing the data and data analysis from PHY 445 Senior Lab at Stony Brook.
Overall very disorganized, but if you squint, there are some good data analysis applets. 
There will be three experiments performed, with data analysis conducted for each. The first 
experiment is on NV- centers.
